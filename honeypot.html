            <h2>Lab 2 HoneyPot</h2>
            <p>
                To my literature point of view: Like the name honey being sweet makes people with sweet tooth struggle
                to stay away from, in another perspective beehives containing a lot of honey is protected from theft and
                the bees attack after detecting an intruder more like a trap. HoneyPot equally being set up as trap lure
                attackers / hackers into their own pandora box as security mechanism through a virtual computer or
                decoy. To reiterate this fools’ intruders into believing that they are succeeding in their plans by
                exploiting a system vulnerability while their actions are being monitored and studied to improve
                security policies, then subsequently put stronger mechanisms to counter cyberattacks. HoneyPot is a
                perfect example of revised Cyber Kill Chain (More info in Cyber Kill Chain here)
            </p>
            <h3>How to set up HoneyPot and how does it work.</h3>
            <p>
                Honeypot can be configured to any computing resource from software and networks to file servers and
                routers. In the most common cases, it is set up as virtual machines on a physical computer and what this
                does is to allow the computer to run programs and deploy apps where it resides on. An example of this
                VMware, Oracle VM VirtualBox or Kali Linux which we used during our ITEC 442 labs activities here are
                the details:

            <h2>Some types of honeypots and how they work:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Deployment types include:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pure honeypots—</strong> These are less sophisticated honeypots and can run easily
                            on any virtual
                            machines. Its primary purpose is to monitor intruders and trap them like prisoners through
                            the links connected to the honeypot network.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low-interaction honeypots—</strong> This is more like adware type where it behaves
                            in ways that
                            hackers find a services or system attractive, more like seducing them in other words, to
                            collect data from attackers with their own tools like botnets, malware, and worms.</li>
                        <li><strong>High-interaction honeypots—</strong> This deployment honeypot is sophisticated to an
                            enterprise level
                            of production infrastructure. In this type, cybercriminals are not very restricted on the
                            things they can do to ensure attackers are able to dive deeper into their intrusion agenda.
                            But this requires experts to handle as it leaves the honey very vulnerable. Regardless of
                            allowing attackers to have high interaction, these systems are still set up on virtual
                            machines to prevent access to the actual system.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <h3>Other types of honeypots include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Email traps or spam traps:</strong> targets spam messages and source IP to add to auto
                        deny to prevent
                        incoming spam mails from the same source.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decoy database:</strong> Helps to detect attacks targeting SQL database and related
                        system frameworks in
                        honeypot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Malware honeypot:</strong> A low-interaction honeypot deployment that attracts malware
                        attacks by
                        mimicking software apps and APIs.</li>
                    <li><strong>A spider honeypot:</strong> With the growing number of websites, web crawlers are
                        equally growing,
                        especially that malicious bots learn nasty ways, downloads, and indexes content from all over
                        the Internet unlike the actual legit Web Crawlers like Google, Bing, and the rest. Spider
                        honeypots can monitor and detect such and block it, including ad-network crawlers.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>Reflection Piece:</h3>
            <p>
                Honeypot, being a tool to trap intrusion by cybercriminals, is also a tool to learn how these hacks work
                in a safe virtual environment, which I have learned. Furthermore, I understood that it helps us discover
                vulnerabilities, perform penetration tests, study them, and find ways to put security measures in place
                to prevent cyberattacks. This can be done by tracing cybercriminal location activities, assessing the
                severity of the threats they expose our systems or networks to, understanding the methods and resources
                intruders are using to carry out their attacks, and determining their end goals in carrying out these
                attacks. As shown in the above-illustrated Smart Grid System on how honeypot works, IoT devices are
                prone to attacks because they deal with so many network links of devices, and honeypots can mitigate
                some of these attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most important things I have learned from this is that cybercriminals can equally be attacked
                with the taste of their own medicine, which honeypots do so effortlessly if done well. Other than what I
                have learned from the class labs, I spent additional time learning more about honeypots, which made me
                develop a deeper interest in utilizing the application where needed if applicable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than what I discovered from the lab activities, there are many benefits and disadvantages that I
                have also learned, which include the following. Generally, the advantages of honeypots outweigh the
                disadvantages, and it is a great Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tool.
            </p>
            <h4>Advantages:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Detect attacks on IoT devices and recommend ways to improve security.</li>
                <li>It handles illegal traffic on a network.</li>
                <li>Honeypot recognizes patterns like similar IP addresses and sources.</li>
                <li>It uses light resources, and most virtual machines used for honeypots are available for free.</li>
                <li>Generally, it has a low false rate compared to other intrusion detection systems, which can trigger
                    high false alerts.</li>
                <li>Many intrusion detection systems ignore internal threats or don't detect them quickly, unlike
                    honeypots, which are very swift in that regard.</li>
                <li>It saves time by preventing hacking of the real computer because it's virtual and a decoy.</li>
                <li>It's always up to date with the latest information and resources on threats, attack vectors,
                    exploits, and malware in cyberspace.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>There are so many means cybercriminals direct their threats, and sometimes it's not directed to
                    honeypots. Therefore, one or IT security shouldn't rely on it 100%.</li>
                <li>Intruders may find out that one is using a honeypot and subsequently target another system.</li>
                <li>Attackers may also feed honeypots inaccurate information to distract a marked honey so they can
                    create spoofed attacks.</li>
                <li>Another downside is that attackers could also use honeypots and weaponize them for their attacks
                    since honeypots are just launchpads.</li>
            </ol>
