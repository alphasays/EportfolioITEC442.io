            <h1>Internet of Things Overview</h1>
            <p> Prediction made by various organizations, the total IoT devices in the market has increased from 
                6.4 billion- 30.9 billion between 2016-2025 respectively. According to McKinsey Institute, the estimated 
                total market value of growing IoT devices is to be 11.1 trillion, a year by 2025. IoT devices have found its
                application in various industries such as consumer IoT, industrial IoT, health IoT, and even internal vehicles.
                IoT has also been referred to by many names. This era IOT is almost at the core of everything we do such as our
                access cards with RFIDS, our smartphones connected to our smart home applications from lights bulbs to various 
                assistance like Alexa, Google even our home appliance. It has made public parking more intelligent by ensuring 
                real-time data and cost efficient for all parties. In these lessons I learned so much about building IOT blocks, 
                from discovering the four basic IoT system –sensors, processors, gateways, applications / could application to 
                diving deeper into other IOT blocks like Energy Management, Data Analytics, Embedded electronics which is highlighted
                below from a class seminar. Machine Intelligence dealing Machine Learning and Article Intelligence. Furthermore,
                I also learned about how a set of IoT Node Ecosystem. The Perception Layer is a set of IoT Nodes that perform
                data collection using sensors and take actions using actuators. The Network Layer transmits the data between 
                the nodes over wide range of communication protocol with the help of gateway nodes. The Processing Layer, 
                analyses and manages accumulated data using IoT platform such as Amazon Web Services and so on. 
                The Action Layer delivers the analytics solution based on the findings from that Processing Layer using appropriate
                human-computer interaction, such as mobile device and smart speakers. As the scale of Edge computing device is 
                predicted to grow, or Edge devices is predicted to grow, the consumption of network traffic, the energy to transport 
                the data over the network and run Big Data Centers for class services will also increase exponentially.
                To conclude on this, with the growing number of IOT devices there is a greater need for security particularly
                cybersecurity. This is because IOT puts everything together using the cyberspace through various communications 
                and processing mechanism with applications our daily livelihood highly depends on. A few to list includes our
                banking applications to atm machines, our hospitals, the education sector, government, public places with devices, 
                and energy industries. All this are at core of our living and any attach affects the mass.</p>
