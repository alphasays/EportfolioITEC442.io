            <h1>Arduino Seminar Overview</h1>
            <p>On Tuesday 16th May 2023, we were visited by guest lecturer Ali Ulker from Dogu Collage for a seminar on
                Arduino. During this seminar, we learned a lot about it. We had a presentation and got hands-on
                experience with the Arduino kit, which consisted of a breadboard, jump wires, resistors, and accessories
                like LED lights and water sensors that work with water or wet sensor triggers. We assembled all these
                parts together for a practical session to see how each one of them works. It was a great experience!</p>
            <p>Here are some key points from the seminar:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Arduino can be used to perform any function based on how well one can program it.</li>
                <li>There are additional features and applications of Arduino beyond what was covered in the seminar.
                </li>
                <li>The seminar instructor shared what he usually teaches the students at lower grades, as they use a
                    different platform, while we used the Arduino studio, which is more complex and suitable for adults.
                </li>
                <li>Regarding where to get Arduino parts, the professor mentioned that they mainly sourced them from
                    Turkey, but they are exploring alternatives and will provide means to buy them if needed.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Reflective Piece: Reflecting on the Arduino Seminar - First-hand Experience on Arduino</h2>
                <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Attending the Arduino seminar was a truly enlightening experience, as
                    it provided me with a comprehensive understanding of this versatile microcontroller platform. The
                    seminar not only enhanced my technical knowledge but also inspired me to explore new horizons of
                    creativity and innovation. In this reflective essay, I will share my key takeaways from the seminar
                    and discuss how it has influenced my perspective on Arduino and its potential for various
                    applications.</p>
