            <h2>Firstly, We Need to Know What is Digitalisation</h2>
            <p>
                Digitization in cybersecurity refers to the process of incorporating digital technology into an
                organization's cybersecurity practices. This involves the use of various digital tools and technologies
                to protect computer networks, devices, and sensitive data from cyber threats. Digitization in
                cybersecurity involves the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning
                (ML), big data analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance an organization's
                cybersecurity posture. These technologies can help organizations to detect and respond to cyber threats
                quickly, automate security operations, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their
                cybersecurity practices.

            <h3>What Are the Security Implications of the Digital Economy?</h3>
            <p>
                According to Wei et al. (2019) and Spremic and Simunic (2018), the digital economy has brought great
                advances and benefits, such as increased efficiency, productivity, and accessibility. However, it also
                creates new and complex cybersecurity challenges that need to be addressed. Wei et al. (2019) and
                Spremic and Simunic (2018) discuss the security implications of the digital economy and highlight the
                risks that all-digital and brick-and-mortar SMEs face in transitioning to digital business.

            <h3>What is a "Fully Digital Enterprise"?</h3>
            <p>
                A fully digital company is one that has no physical presence, operates exclusively online, and conducts
                all its business activities digitally. These companies rely heavily on information technology and are
                vulnerable to various cyber threats such as malware, phishing attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks,
                and data breaches. These attacks can have serious consequences, including financial loss, reputational
                damage, and legal liability.
            </p>

            <h3>What Are the Cyber Security Challenges/Concerns with a Fully Digital Enterprise?</h3>
            <p>
                Fully digitized businesses face several cybersecurity challenges and concerns due to their dependence on
                digital technology and their online presence. The main challenges and concerns are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data breach: All-digital companies handle large amounts of sensitive data, including customer
                    information, financial data, and intellectual property. Data breaches can cause significant
                    financial and reputational damage to businesses and expose them to legal liability.</li>
                <li>Malware and viruses: Malware and viruses can infect corporate systems and networks, compromise
                    security, and disrupt business operations.</li>
                <li>Phishing attack: A phishing attack is a fraudulent email or message that tricks an employee into
                    divulging sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link, causing a data or system breach.
                </li>
                <li>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks: DDoS attacks overload corporate systems and networks
                    with traffic, making them unavailable to legitimate users.</li>
                <li>Insider Threat: Insiders such as employees, contractors, and partners can intentionally or
                    accidentally cause data and system breaches.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Are the Cyber Security Challenges for a Brick and Mortar SME Wanting to Become a Digital
                Enterprise?</h3>
            <p>
                Brick-and-mortar SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) looking to do digital business face
                cybersecurity challenges such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of cybersecurity expertise: SMBs may not have the in-house expertise to design and implement
                    robust cybersecurity measures. This can leave them vulnerable to cyberattacks and data breaches.
                </li>
                <li>Insufficient budget for cybersecurity: SMBs may have limited resources for cybersecurity. This
                    can lead to inadequate cybersecurity measures and increased vulnerability to cyber threats.</li>
                <li>Poor infrastructure: Stationary small businesses may lack the hardware, software, and network
                    infrastructure needed to securely support their digital operations.</li>
                <li>Employee awareness: Employees may not be aware of the cybersecurity risks associated with digital
                    work. As a result, they may engage in risky behavior that compromises the security of the
                    organization.</li>
                <li>Risks in the supply chain: Small businesses rely on third-party providers for a variety of services,
                    such as payment processing and logistics. If these third parties have weak security practices, they
                    can pose a cybersecurity risk to the organization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>PCI DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</h3>
            <p>This global security standard for information is designed to enhance control over credit card data to
                prevent fraud. All businesses regardless of size must follow PCI DSS requirements if they accept credit
                card payments from the five major brands. Those brands are American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa,
                and the Japan Credit Bureau (JCB). For any organization that processes, stores, or transmits cardholder
                and payment data, PCI DSS compliance is required.</p>
