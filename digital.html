            <h1>A fully digital enterprise</h1>
            <p>A fully digital enterprise refers to an organization that has successfully transformed its operations,
                processes, and activities by leveraging digital technologies and tools, also known as digital
                transformation. In such an enterprise, digital technologies are deeply integrated into every aspect of
                the organization's operations, enabling increased efficiency, agility, and innovation with access to
                real-time data. This consists of various digital features such as:</p>
            <ul>

            <h3>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022</h3>
            <p> Oh yes! Absolutely. Let us just look at the Russia-Ukraine war. With all the sanctions on Russia has brought about
                some of the highest energy crisis particularly in Europe. The Nord stream destruction equally had a huge impact on 
                global energy from later 2022, making some countries to almost go into recession. Because they are now buying more 
                expensive energy from other sources like OPEC members. On the hand the ExxonMobil Corporation is benefiting significantly
                from this resulting to the highest profit they have ever made. Saudi Arabia Aramco has risen to the top 10 of the most 
                valuable companies as the demand for surge around the world due to energy crisis. 
                The global energy crisis experienced worldwide in 2022 has further highlighted the importance of digital
                enterprises. The rise in energy costs has impacted businesses heavily, emphasizing the need for
                efficient operations and cost-effective solutions. Additionally, advances in technology offer innovative
                approaches to address challenges and solve problems. However, the energy crisis also poses risks,
                including cyberattacks and the need to adapt to the growing digital world while managing energy
                consumption effectively.</p>

                <h3> Cyber Security Challenges in Digital Economy </h3>


            <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is an agency of the United States Department of
                Commerce whose mission is to promote American innovation and industrial competitiveness. I learned about
                this during the lectures as a side note. </p>

            </div>

            <h3>PCI DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</h3>
            <p>This global security standard for information is designed to enhance control over credit card data to
                prevent fraud. All businesses regardless of size must follow PCI DSS requirements if they accept credit
                card payments from the five major brands. Those brands are American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa,
                and the Japan Credit Bureau (JCB). For any organization that processes, stores, or transmits cardholder
                and payment data, PCI DSS compliance is required.</p>
