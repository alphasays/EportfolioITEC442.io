            <h1>A fully digital enterprise</h1>
            <p>A fully digital enterprise refers to an organization that has successfully transformed its operations,
                processes, and activities by leveraging digital technologies and tools, also known as digital
                transformation. In such an enterprise, digital technologies are deeply integrated into every aspect of
                the organization's operations, enabling increased efficiency, agility, and innovation with access to
                real-time data. This consists of various digital features such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Infrastructure:</strong> A combination of hardware, software, networks, and
                    cloud-based systems
                    necessary to support digital operations and achieve a full digital enterprise.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Process Automation:</strong> Replacing or automating traditional manual and
                    paper-based processes
                    with digital solutions, including areas such as document management, workflow automation, and data
                    analytics, which contributes to data-driven decision making.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Customer Experience:</strong> Utilizing Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
                    systems to improve
                    interaction and enhance satisfaction through personalized marketing.</li>
                <li><strong>Cybersecurity and Data Privacy:</strong> Ensuring the safe storage and protection of data
                    with the right
                    policies and security measures in place, as the fundamental part of a digital enterprise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examples of fully digital enterprises that I am particularly experienced with include the Integrated
                Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) for public finance management used in the Gambia, Kenya, Ethiopia  
                and every country in Latin America has an IFMIS system for state funds, payroll and other governemnt activites. Another one is the Diplomatic Portal
                developed by the Turkish Government. These systems demonstrate how digital technologies can streamline
                operations, improve efficiency, and provide enhanced services in sectors like finance and diplomacy.</p>

            <h2>While digital transformation offers numerous benefits, it also poses certain cybersecurity challenges and
                concerns. Some of these challenges include:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):</strong> Sophisticated and prolonged cyber-attacks aimed
                    at gaining
                    unauthorized access to a network, which can target valuable data and interconnected systems in a
                    fully digital enterprise.</li>
                <li><strong>Insider Threats:</strong> Employees, contractors, or partners who may intentionally or
                    inadvertently
                    compromise data security, potentially through theft or leakage of sensitive information or falling
                    victim to social engineering attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Cybercriminals targeting fully digital enterprises to gain
                    unauthorized access to
                    sensitive information, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Securing cloud environments, considering issues such as
                    misconfiguration, insecure
                    APIs, data breaches due to shared infrastructure, and data loss or leakage, especially in regions
                    with limited power or internet stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Security:</strong> Additional security risks introduced by the pervasive use of
                    mobile devices in a
                    fully digital enterprise, including data exposure, malware infections, and unauthorized access if
                    not adequately managed and secured.</li>
                <li><strong>IoT Vulnerabilities:</strong> The potential vulnerabilities introduced by Internet of Things
                    (IoT) devices
                    and sensors used in a fully digital enterprise, which can be exploited by attackers to gain
                    unauthorized access or disrupt operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance and Regulations:</strong> The need for fully digital enterprises to comply with
                    industry
                    regulations and data protection laws, while maintaining strong cybersecurity measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Risks: </strong> The cybersecurity risks associated with third-party vendors,
                    partners, and
                    suppliers, which need to be assessed and managed in a network of interconnected systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>For a bricks and mortar SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprise) looking to become a digital enterprise,
                there are specific cybersecurity challenges to consider:</h2>
            <br>
           
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Limited Resources:</strong> SMEs often struggle with limited budgets and resources, which
                    can make it harder
                    to invest in strong cybersecurity measures, including hiring security personnel and IT experts.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Awareness and Training:</strong> Ensuring that employees are aware of cybersecurity
                    threats and best
                    practices is crucial for reducing attacks, including insider threats, social engineering, and
                    phishing attempts.</li>
                <li><strong>Old and Obsolete Systems and Infrastructure:</strong> Limited resources may make it
                    challenging for SMEs to
                    upgrade to modern systems with good infrastructure, potentially introducing vulnerabilities if
                    proper security controls are not implemented.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Vendors and Supply Chain Risk:</strong> SMEs often rely on third-party vendors
                    and suppliers,
                    introducing potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to stay safe from hacks and ensure
                    security beyond their own applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Protection and Privacy:</strong> Establishing proper data protection and privacy
                    measures becomes
                    essential as SMEs collect and store more digital data, requiring compliance with data protection
                    regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Adoption:</strong> Embracing cloud services introduces a different set of security
                    considerations,
                    requiring careful evaluation of cloud providers, understanding shared responsibility models, and
                    implementing proper configurations and access controls.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability and Flexibility:</strong> Balancing growth and scalability with robust
                    cybersecurity practices
                    can be a challenge for SMEs during their digital transformation journey.</li>
            </ol>

          
            <p>As a Google Workspace admin, I am constantly monitoring and addressing cybersecurity threats, including
                spoofing, to ensure the security of our digital enterprise. This are similar challenges as above and 
            almost all businesses online goes through similar challenges</p>

                </div>

            <p>In summary, achieving a fully digital enterprise brings numerous benefits, but it also requires
                addressing cybersecurity challenges and considering the specific concerns faced by different types of
                organizations, such as SMEs.</p>

            <h3>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022</h3>
            <p> Oh yes! Absolutely. Let us just look at the Russia-Ukraine war. With all the sanctions on Russia has brought about
                some of the highest energy crisis particularly in Europe. The Nord stream destruction equally had a huge impact on 
                global energy from later 2022, making some countries to almost go into recession. Because they are now buying more 
                expensive energy from other sources like OPEC members. On the hand the ExxonMobil Corporation is benefiting significantly
                from this resulting to the highest profit they have ever made. Saudi Arabia Aramco has risen to the top 10 of the most 
                valuable companies as the demand for surge around the world due to energy crisis. 
                The global energy crisis experienced worldwide in 2022 has further highlighted the importance of digital
                enterprises. The rise in energy costs has impacted businesses heavily, emphasizing the need for
                efficient operations and cost-effective solutions. Additionally, advances in technology offer innovative
                approaches to address challenges and solve problems. However, the energy crisis also poses risks,
                including cyberattacks and the need to adapt to the growing digital world while managing energy
                consumption effectively.</p>

                <h3> Cyber Security Challenges in Digital Economy </h3>
                <p> Digital Economy is among the fastest growing sector in the tech and finance industry
                    as almost every parts of the world embrace morden effrotly ways to do transactions. It is 
                    a worldwide network of economic activites activities, commercial transactions and 
                    professional interactions that are enabled by Information and Communication Technology -ICT.
                    This includes all types of online payments or transactions aided with digital. With the growing 
                    of Cyptocurrancy and other online transaction methods Cyber Security in digital economy is a must!
                    Blockchain Technology has aided in making sure the methods of recording information becomes impossible 
                    or difficult for a system to be changed, hacked or manipulated. 
                    
                    <h4> Mario Spremić, Member, IAENG, Alen Šimunic article on Cyber Security Challenges in Digital Economy</h4> 
                    According to their reaseach piece where they highltied the large-scale breach of cyber security as one of the five most serious risks facing the world today with an estimated of US$6 trillion
                    by 2021 due to the global cost of cyber security. In her paper she also discussed information
                    security and cyber security, how to protect ongoing cyber threats with more holistic approach in governing them. To reiterate on 
                    her finding on security challenge in digital economy. 1, Major problems associated with IT/cyber
                    security are employees not aware of the cyber security issues. 2, cyber security regulations, either at national or international
                    level, majority of the companies spend around 1% of total income for cyber security and all have key internal acts like IT security
                    or cyber security policy in place with making cyber security a core part of business strategy and culture. 3, CEO's and top level executives 
                    are informed about cyber risks but mainly during reports or when a serious attacks happens. However, most of the high level decision makers 
                    still assume cyber security is solely the responsibility of IT departments or assigned individuals ignoring their vulnerabilities as high 
                    level targets by attackers or ensuring security related budget is considered essential. 4 Another major challenge is ineffective preventive and
                    detective controls, companies either underestimate cyber threats or are very confident that controls to mitigate them are effective and efficient 
                    without doing tough penetration test and other intrusion dectection measures.

            <p> <h4  National Institute of Standards and Technology ></h4> NIST is an agency of the United States Department of
                Commerce whose mission is to promote American innovation and industrial competitiveness. I learned about
                this during the lectures as a side note. The picture below shows how the NIST Cybersecurity framework that 
                has essential prevention methods for the commercial industry </p>

            <h3>PCI DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</h3>
            <p>This global security standard for information is designed to enhance control over credit card data to
                prevent fraud. All businesses regardless of size must follow PCI DSS requirements if they accept credit
                card payments from the five major brands. Those brands are American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa,
                and the Japan Credit Bureau (JCB). For any organization that processes, stores, or transmits cardholder
                and payment data, PCI DSS compliance is required. As we learn about digital economy PCI DDS becomes core 
                part of the process, it gives the room for card payemtn standard to ensure all core features are met to 
                handle cybersecurity related with payments. This was great insight to learn about in this course</p>
