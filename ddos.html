            <h3>Learning about SYN DDS</h3>
            <p>
                SYN flooding is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that disrupts the functioning of a network or
                website by overwhelming it with a flood of SYN requests which results to exhausting its resources making
                it to stop working or responding. The attack exploits the TCP three-way handshake process, which is used
                to establish a connection between a client and a server.
            </p>
            <p>

                During the three-way handshake, the client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, and the
                server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet. The client then sends an ACK
                (acknowledge) packet to complete the connection. In a SYN flooding attack, the attacker sends a large
                number of SYN packets to the target system, but either does not respond to the SYN-ACK packets or sends
                spoofed source IP addresses.
                Here is an example picture to illustrate the process.

            </p>

            <h3>How I perfumed SYN using Metasploit?</h3>
            <p>
                I started by identifying my target website which rightnow.com.tr a website I build for my graduation
                project. I used ping on mac Terminal with slight title adjustment to remain it. The PING rightnow.com.tr
                displayed (185.46.40.47) as the ip address which I would use for the next step then got I got 56 as data
                bytes with additional request details as seen below.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is essential to remember that honeypots should not be relied upon as the sole security measure, as
                cybercriminals can adapt and find ways to circumvent them. However, when implemented effectively
                alongside
                other security measures, honeypots can serve as an invaluable tool in detecting and mitigating attacks,
                gaining insights into attacker behavior, and improving overall security posture.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Kali Terminal I typed msconsole to launch metaploit since I already know my site ip which is
                185.46.40.47 <br>


                Followed by using the selected "auxiliary/dos/TCP/synflood" done by typing the following command Msf6 >
                use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood
                Msf6> show options <br>

                Now we have all options available that we can configure. To set an option just you have to typeset and
                the option name and option.
                You have to set two main option<br>
                RHOST= target IP Address <br>
                RPORT= target PORT Address <br>
                Set RPORT 18.192.182.30
            </p>
            <h2>Set RPORT 80</h2>
            <p>At the final phase I launched the attack by typing: exploit to check the packets I could open on
                Wireshark.</p>
            <h2>Reflection Peace:</h2>
            <p>Challenges: This part of the hardest challenge I went through during my activities. At first I tried
                doing it during the class and didn’t work due to certain restriction of some of the computers at the lap
                but I had a support from one of my classmates, it worked on another computer but I forgot to save the
                pictures until the lab PC restarted making me loss the work, at home using a friends computer that also
                gave me some challenges, since my laptop was a mac and my storage left is 128GB, running virtual box was
                another nightmare as my remaining storage was just 8.GB with my core files and application.

            </p><br>
            <p>Other lessons learned: A cyber-attach that by a WannaCry ransomware leading to disrupting more than 80
                hospitals and costing the government an estimated $90 million and more than 60 trusts within the United
                Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) has spread to more than 200 000 computer systems in 150
                countries, including Canada. One hospital in Ontario — Lakeridge Health in Oshawa — reported that its
                computer system was threatened by the ransomware disabling their Smart System in 2018. Although this was
                a Malware ransomware, but it had other attacks features such Kill Chain and Supply Chain attack since it
                started from 2016 from reports states 2015. The result of this was of Denial of Service attach because
                their system completely stopped working due to the attack. <br> On the hand I also learned about HIPAA -
                The
                Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This defines the security and privacy regulations
                required to protect sensitive patient health information. Specifically, the Act addresses requirements
                for handling protected health information (PHI) and electronic protected health information (ePHI). A
                photo below illustrates how this works. Early this month, The US President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden
                laptop leaked data was published online and due to the sensitivity and it’s political affiliation the
                FBI immediately attacked the website with Denial of Service (DoS) making the site not work at all so the
                public can’t access it.
