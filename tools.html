            <h2>Lecture One: Scanning Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Perform a basic scan using standard tools such as traceroute, dig, and nslookup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scanning tools help us understand our network information by giving us data on the incoming and outgoing
                communication through the bits and its ports. Since a computer network layer performs various activities
                through the transmission of data from one host to another, located in different networks, packets get
                sent as Information Form (Data Unit) which the router as a device takes the next action. In the popular
                network field, it’s said, "The network is known as the backbone of the telecommunication system which is
                used to share data and resources using data links."
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond finding information about our network through scanning tools, it’s also a great tool for
                vulnerability testing, which helps users find information on weak communication links that, if not
                monitored well and secured, could lead to network attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this lab activity, I will share some of the tools we used during our lab activities, the outcome of
                the activities, the things we learned, and a few tips to help you better understand the good and bad
                side of scanning tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this lab activity, the first tool we used was ping, which shows the internet status seen in the
                images below. Then we tried ipconfig through the command line prompt and discovered the computer's
                detailed IP configuration, further exploring various scanning tools.

            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
            <p>
                Scanning tools, being tools to discover network communication information, can also mean network
                vulnerability. Also, one should not freak out when they see so many ports opened in their network or the
                sites they’re accessing. The work involved in this OSI layer model is too complex for a human to
                comprehend and manually attempt to manage so many ports, as thousands or millions of packets operate in
                the TCP/IP based on the network size. For the questions I had to use other websites to get EMU host
                details which made me discover other ways to do find out website details, the emu hosting details is
                different on different
                site, some shows Turkey like Nsloookup.io and others Nicosia, I believe it has to do with various
                applications, cloud servers, local servers and backup
                servers. I also learned if the information of a domain is restricted on one site, another site with more
                powerful tools can help you discover the information you are looking for. In Summary one can never hide
                their domain information 100%. I was also using a mac which makes some features limited and more complex
                and
                I had to use a friends computer to perform some this activites.
