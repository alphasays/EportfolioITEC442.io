            <h2>OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2023</h2>
            <p>Firstly, we need to know what OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is. It is a non-profit
                organization focused on improving software security. OWASP identifies the most dangerous security
                threats to web applications, ranks them based on their frequency of occurrence and severity of impact.
                Here are the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities 2023 that every web and application developer should be aware
                of before proceeding with development.</p>

            <h3>OWASP Top 10 List</h3>
            <p>Injection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As a broad attack category, injection occurs when entrusted code or malware is input in a way that
                    allows attackers to alter key commands.</li>
                <li>These injection attacks rely on coding vulnerabilities that enable unauthorized users to enter
                    input.</li>
                <li>Previously the number one threat, injection dropped to third place during the 2021 update.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Insecure design:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encompasses many risks that arise early in the development process.</li>
                <li>Requires a security-first mindset with more threat modeling, secure design patterns, principles, and
                    reference architectures.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Cryptographic failures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Refers to leaks or breaches caused by encryption issues or lack thereof.</li>
                <li>Data encryption is essential for cybersecurity, but it requires careful assessment based on the
                    threat model.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Broken access control:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Occurs when unauthorized parties gain access to protected systems and user accounts.</li>
                <li>Applications with broken access control fail to enforce the rule of least privilege.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Vulnerable and outdated components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As application architecture becomes more complex, outdated components pose a higher risk of
                    exploitation by cybercriminals.</li>
                <li>Proactive vetting and updating of third-party components are crucial for security.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Identification and authentication failures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Occurs when applications have flaws related to password protection or session identifiers.</li>
                <li>Risks include weak passwords, credential stuffing, and session hijacking.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Software and data integrity failures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrity violations in code and infrastructure can lead to security flaws impacting frameworks and
                    client-side machines.</li>
                <li>Involves reliance on plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Server-side request forgery
                (SSRF):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SSRF occurs when web application flaws allow malicious parties to access or modify resources through
                    server functionality.</li>
                <li>It is similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), but involves a
                    compromised server.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tips to protect your application</h3>
            <p>Security scanning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vulnerability scanning provides oversight and reveals key vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Encryption:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong encryption is crucial for protecting data. SSL certificates are recommended for encrypted
                    links between clients and servers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Log files:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Security logging is impactful for verifying current security and identifying incidents and policy
                    violations.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Authorization:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement proper authorization to verify access rights and follow the principle of least privilege.
                </li>
                <li>Deny-by-default approach should be implemented to deny all traffic that is not explicitly permitted.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Authentication:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authentication processes verify identity and should enforce strong passwords and use Transport Layer
                    Security (TLS) for login pages.</li>
                <li>Re-authentication should be implemented to prevent session hijacking and cross-site request forgery.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation</h3>
            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation is a Regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the EU
                and
                the European Economic Area. The GDPR is an important component of EU privacy law and of human rights
